# 3D to 3D pipeline based on Stable-Dreamfusion,

A pytorch implementation of the 3D-to-3D pipeline based on [Stable-Dreamfusion](https://github.com/ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion) text-to-3D model.

Colab notebook for usage: [![Open In Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BN9N1k8oQwXFWBF8PZElQtW3QFzGsAJG/view?usp=sharing)

# Important Notice
This project is a **work-in-progress**, welcome for any contribution and collaboration.
The main problems in stable-dreamfusion are still unsolved.
- Alleviate the multi-face Janus problem.
- Better mesh (improve the surface quality).


# Install (refer to [ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion](https://github.com/ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion))


```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion.git
cd stable-dreamfusion

**Important**: To download the Stable Diffusion model checkpoint, you should provide your [access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). You could choose either of the following ways:
* Run `huggingface-cli login` and enter your token.
* Create a file called `TOKEN` under this directory (i.e., `stable-dreamfusion/TOKEN`) and copy your token into it.

### Install with pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# install nvdiffrast for exporting textured mesh (--save_mesh)
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast/

```

### Build extension (optional)
By default, we use [`load`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cpp_extension.html#torch.utils.cpp_extension.load) to build the extension at runtime.
We also provide the `setup.py` to build each extension:
```bash
# install all extension modules
bash scripts/install_ext.sh

# if you want to install manually, here is an example:
pip install ./raymarching # install to python path (you still need the raymarching/ folder, since this only installs the built extension.)
```

### Tested environments
* torch 1.12 & CUDA 11.6 on a V100.


# Usage
## Dataset
Our 3D-to-3D pipeline aims to transfer human skeletons with different poses to novel 3D assets in blender.
We collect the 100 images from 100 camera poses on a circle orbit for each pose.
The blender scripts and all dataset can be found at [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lpXdhT5pFoaINw__csJhp1wtxD2DBO5n?usp=sharing).

Please download the dataset folder and place in `./stable-dreamfusion`.

## Run command

First, to pre-train a NeRF with downloaded poses dataset. (we provided the model.pth in the drive)

```bash
# pre-train NeRF
python main.py --text "pose_1" -O3 --gt_dir dataset/pose_1 --save_mesh
```

# transfer pretrained NeRF.

```bash
# --reload_model to load pretrain model from pretrain_ckpt.
python main.py --text "a raccoon astronaut" -O3 --nerf_transfer --pretrain_ckpt ./pretrain_models/model.pth --reload_model --save_mesh
```
